# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository is for my Tech Academy HTML and CSS projects.
So far the main projects I have done are "Cyber 2050 Tour" and "CDA Cinemas".

Cyber 2050 Tour is a website to get tickets to a futuristic tour.  I have pictures of tech/futuristic cites and animations along with the pictures.

CDA Cinemas is a website made using bootstrap and it a cinemas website for CDA Idaho, showing upcoming movies/TV shows, and current ones playing.
